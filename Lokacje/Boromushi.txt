Boromushi is an ominous swamp island, covered with dense, dark primeval forests that seem to absorb the light and hope of anyone who dares to enter. The island is inhabited exclusively by swamp creatures, hiding in the murky water or in damp, hollowed-out cavities. These implacable beasts are deadly hostile to anyone who dares to violate their territory. Many times attempts have been made to colonize Boromushi, but each attempt has ended in dismal defeat - the swamp monsters have defended their kingdom with cold determination, turning any human ambitions into useless wrecks at the bottom of the quagmires.
