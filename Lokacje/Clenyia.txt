Clenyia is a small but influential kingdom in the lands of Esterath, neighboring frost-bitten Aresia, picturesque Alornard and treacherous Reughtar. Known for her neutral reputation, Clenyia did not enter into alliances or conflicts, remaining a cool observer of events on the continent. Clenyia did not share any of the neighboring lands with sympathy, but she also did not pester anyone, choosing the path of cautious distance. Despite her many political dilemmas, Clenyia managed to build her power on trade and skillful maneuvering of influence, especially after the fall of Aresia, when her interests began to center around Alornard and Reughtar - though both of these lands were not happy with her pragmatic decisions.
