The north of Aresia is drowning in eternal winter, where frigid winds never cease and the sun seems a forgotten dream. The low temperatures, brought about by the magic of the XA-57 particle, have turned everything familiar into terrifying ice counterparts. Forms that once teemed with life now stand as chilly monuments to their former glory. This cursed magic has caused mutations in animals, turning them into terrifying ice monsters with eyes full of icy cruelty. Humans, once the rulers of these lands, have been completely consumed by the curse of the blue cold, transformed into soulless frost knights whose minds see only the Ice Lady - the implacable ruler of this icy void, holding their souls in an iron grip. Her presence permeates every corner of this land, like an icy shadow from which there is no escape.
