The south of Aresia was completely incinerated by the destructive power of the red curse, fueled by the cursed particle XA-57. On the day of the apocalypse, fate mocked the inhabitants of these lands - a storm broke over southern Aresia, which turned from wet, torrential rain into a raging hail of fire, falling to the ground in the form of burning meteorites. People's minds were enveloped in merciless heat, and their bodies were consumed by flames that scorched everything they once knew and held dear. Nothing looked like it used to anymore. Huge meteorites falling from the sky left deep, bloody scars on the surface of Aresia, the sight of which inspires horror to this day - a lifeless reminder of the day when fire consumed everything.
