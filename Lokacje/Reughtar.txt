Reughtar is a tainted land, full of hatred and pervasive evil, a place that lacks even the slightest trace of happiness, joy or compassion. This land is filled with gloomy forests, dark caves and nooks and crannies that, under the influence of black magic, have become places that strike terror into the hearts of even the bravest. Every patch of this cursed land exudes unease, as if nature itself wanted to renounce what Reughtar had become. The people who once lived here have been transformed by dark spells into Urgas - bloodthirsty beasts, devoid of any remnants of empathy, whose hearts beat only with hatred. Their entire existence is fueled by hatred for Alornard, and every step they take and every word they utter seems only a prelude to further acts of brutality and destruction.
