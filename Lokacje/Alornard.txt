Alornard is a land of quiet, mysterious forests and dense wildernesses, dotted with valleys and hills, where nature rules by its wild laws. These vast forests are teeming with all kinds of game, as well as untamed creatures that no one has yet tamed. Amidst this wild scenery live the Hunters - ordinary people who, in camps hidden deep in the valleys, perfect the art of camouflage, becoming almost invisible guardians of their lands. Alornard is constantly in a state of conflict with Reughtar. The Urgs of Reughtar have long harbored resentment toward the Hunters, and their mutual hostility has turned into a daily game of cat and mouse. Covert operations, frequent patrols and nightly forays have become the daily bread of Alornard, and its inhabitants have learned to live under the shadow of danger, constantly ready to defend their forest homes from enemies who know no peace.
