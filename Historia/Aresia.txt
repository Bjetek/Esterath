Aresia – once a beautiful, powerful kingdom, full of bustling cities, peaceful villages, majestic
fortresses, and mysterious corners that hid dark secrets. Its lands were called the "Dragon
Lands," though these winged beasts did not actually reside there. This name came from the
deep faith of the inhabitants in the Holy Dragons. In the southern part of the kingdom stood the
largest Temple of the Holy Dragons in all of Esterath, a testament to their devotion to this belief.
Aresia, compared to other kingdoms, was a vast territory respected by every ruler. A well-trained
army, thriving trade, master craftsmen, and the famous, widely visited inns at crossroads – these
were just a few fragments of what made Aresia so influential. Wealthy merchants, politicians,
and explorers from all over Esterath visited these lands for trade and diplomacy, as well as to
uncover the secrets of Aresia.

The people of Aresia lived in prosperity, and poverty was almost nonexistent. Both in cities and
villages, the level of culture and mutual assistance was exceptionally high. The community was
like one big family, where everyone cared for one another. This closeness made Aresia one of
the safest kingdoms in Esterath – robberies and murders were extremely rare, even in the
darkest corners of the night. Evening walks, full of reflection and tranquility, were a beloved
pastime for many.

Crime was minimal, as anyone who disturbed the peace quickly faced strict punishment. There
was no place for injustice in the Dragon Lands. Pilgrimages to the Temple of the Holy Dragons
were particularly popular, with routes passing through the most beautiful and picturesque places
in Aresia – from Sylvan Valley, through Rat Canyon and the Deep Forest, to the Mountain
Passes and the solitary hill.
Each of these places had its own legends, like the tale of the Devil of Sylvan Valley, who settled
at the bottom of the valley in search of a peaceful lair. Was it true? No one knows for certain.
And what about magic? In Aresia, only Mages and Archmages from the royal court had access
to magic, which was used solely for scientific and life-enhancing purposes. Using magic for any
other purpose was strictly forbidden and written into the Great Book of law. However, this law
applied only to those who knew it. In the villages, where people rarely reached for the heavy
tome, the rules were more flexible.
Everything changed one day when the Archmages, in secret from the king, decided to break the
law and create a new, powerful magical particle capable of controlling any being – a human
mind, body, or even soul. Their research involved brutal experiments on animals, kidnapped
people, and even newly created magical beings.
After many tests, they managed to create a prototype – named XA-57. However, to their
surprise, the prototype split into two parts – one emitted a cool, blue glow, while the other
burned with hot, red energy. Though they differed in appearance, the core of both remained
identical.

The last notes speak of uncontrolled tests and catastrophic consequences. Two explosions of
unimaginable power scattered XA-57 particles across all of Aresia, spreading chaos. Human
minds, animals, and creatures inhabiting the kingdom were bound by two opposing curses.
Aresia plunged into chaos – a great war erupted, a war of two ideologies that had no end.
The kingdom was divided into Northern and Southern Aresia, and an enormous canyon was
carved along the borders with Alornard and Clenya to protect the neighboring lands from the
madness. Since those events, decades have passed, thousands of beings have lost their lives,
and Aresia, once a symbol of prosperity and power, has become a land of endless war and
suffering.
