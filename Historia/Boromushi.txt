Boromushi Island was born in ancient times, when
powerful forces unknown to the world tore a fragment of
land from the lands of Esterath, long before human feet
touched these lands. Isolated from the rest of the world, the
island developed in a mysterious way, unknown to anyone,
and life on it took shape in a unique way. In the thick mists
and depths of the swamps, the first bloodthirsty beasts
began to emerge - swamp creatures, which, as the first
inhabitants of Boromushi, became not only a part of this
wild land, but also its unyielding guardians. It is they,
hidden among the tangled roots, dark waters and dark
marshes, who have been making sure that no one uninvited
disturbs the eternal harmony of their lands since the dawn
of time.
