Many years ago, Reughtar was a peaceful and prosperous land, with its inhabitants enjoying an abundance
of resources. However, one day, through a perfectly executed coup, someone who should never have
come to power took control. Legend has it that the new ruler suffered from severe mental disorders and
adhered to an ideology of Reughtar's superiority over other lands in Esterath. His obsession became
Alornard, which, in his view, had been granted lands unjustly during the creation of the world.
The new ruler, disrupting the region's balance, began gaining more and more followers, creating an anti-
Alornard movement that grew over many years. Yet no one dared to launch a direct attack, as Alornard
had a powerful ally in Aresia. A war with these two lands would have ended in a swift defeat, the collapse
of morale, and the destruction of the anti-Alornard movement.
Unfortunately, over time, the Aresian Schism occurred, which Reughtar saw as the perfect opportunity for
a final attack and the realization of its ideology. However, due to the "Great Underground" plan, Reughtar
suffered enormous losses and was ultimately forced to retreat to its old lands. An enormous wall was
immediately built along the border, fearing retaliation from Alornard. Alornard, with no intention of
invading Reughtar, also built its own great wall, hoping that Reughtar's defeat would completely topple
the anti-Alornard ideology.

In Reughtar, the defeat brought a moment of calm and reflection. It was then that Gurbrand, the future
ruler, set out on an expedition deep into the unexplored lands of Reughtar, searching for a new meaning to
the old idea. After many days of wandering, he came upon a mysterious, encrypted scroll in a ruined city.
Returning home, he gathered a group of scholars and the most important figures to decode the scroll. The
task was not easy and took long time.
When they finally managed to break the code, they discovered that the scroll was the key to developing
blood magic – a young, still not fully mastered power. Numerous experiments were conducted on plants,
animals, and eventually humans. Gurbrand, in the name of his ideology, did not shy away from anything.
After months of trials, they managed to harness and advance blood magic, leading to the emergence of
specialists in its use – the so-called Blood Priests.
Ultimately, through blood magic, they discovered the ability of mutation, which allowed them to
transform living beings. This led to the creation of the first Urgs – humans who, through mutation, gained
superhuman strength, endurance, and mental abilities. Soon, every inhabitant of Reughtar was forced to
undergo mutation. Those who refused were publicly branded as traitors and killed, as a means of
intimidating the rest of society.
In this way, Gurbrand created a new army, a new Reughtar, and above all, a new ideology – although, in
reality, it was the same old hatred for Alornard, only in a new form. Reughtar, rebuilding its strength, was
continually preparing to reclaim what it believed was its eternal right.
