Alornard, thousands of years ago, appeared at first glance to be an ordinary kingdom – with
castles, towns, quiet groves, and all the necessary infrastructure. Life there flowed peacefully,
though perhaps not as prosperously as in neighboring Aresia. Nevertheless, the people of
Alornard took great pride in their country. They were deeply connected to the land of their
ancestors, and their identity was built on this profound bond. Alornard did not stand out much
compared to other kingdoms – it maintained good relations, developed trade, had a strong army,
and enjoyed political stability. It needed nothing more. Alornard’s closest ties were with Aresia –
the two kingdoms were like brothers, and people often speculated when they would unite.
Relations with Clenia were stable – there was no great love between them, but trade flowed
without hindrance. However, the greatest tensions existed with Reughtar, which had long
claimed that the borders between Reughtar and Alornard were unjustly drawn centuries ago.

Reughtar demanded changes, threatening conflict. Despite this tense situation at the borders,
life in Alornard continued without much worry. People lived day by day, not thinking about war.
However, everything changed with the Split of Great Aresia. The loss of influence, trade routes,
and most importantly, their strongest ally, weakened Alornard. Reughtar, sensing an opportunity,
launched the long-awaited attack, aiming to reclaim the lands that it believed rightfully belonged
to it. Reughtar’s army was larger, better trained, and more experienced, which quickly led to
Alornard suffering defeats on the battlefield.
Facing the threat of total annihilation, a desperate plan was devised – the “Great Underground.”
This plan, though risky and difficult to execute, could save the kingdom. Alornard was full of vast
caves, deep valleys, and tunnels, which would become a new refuge for its people. A mass
evacuation underground was their only hope for survival. When Reughtar entered the deserted
lands, it was convinced of victory. The towns and villages of Alornard were empty, as if ghosts
had fled in haste. But this was merely the calm before the storm. Alornard, hidden beneath the
earth, was not about to surrender. A newly trained army, called the “Hunters,” adapted to silent
combat in the shadows, began a brutal underground campaign. From their hiding places, they
eliminated Reughtar’s camps before the enemy could even grasp their weapons. The attacks
were swift, precise, and merciless. The enemy had no idea where the blow would come from or
when the next one would strike. Despite its might, Reughtar was powerless against this new
tactic. After many bloody skirmishes, when Reughtar’s losses became too great, they made the
long-awaited decision to retreat. Reughtar’s army withdrew from Alornard’s lands, though
destroying everything in its path. Although Alornard ultimately won the war, the kingdom was left
in ruins. Those who tried to return to the surface found only rubble. In the face of this new reality,
they decided to remain underground, where they began transforming their refuge into a
permanent home. The tunnel system was expanded, new structures were built, and the shelters,
which had initially been temporary, became the new heart of Alornard – the Camps. Thus,
Alornard wrote its great history, survived, and rebuilt itself, despite the odds.
