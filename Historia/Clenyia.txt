Clenyia had always been a small, quiet kingdom, avoiding conflicts with the other lands of Esterath. For
centuries, it maintained a policy of neutrality and diplomacy, never seeking enemies and striving to
resolve any disputes peacefully. However, this didn’t mean it was defenseless – its army, though modest,
was well-trained and ready to defend its borders if needed.
Despite its military potential, the internal affairs of Clenyia were far less harmonious. The unfavorable
reigns of a dynasty that passed the throne from generation to generation gradually led to chaos and decay
within society. The rulers were too absorbed in their own ambitions, allowing selfishness to spread among
the people. Many citizens began thinking solely of personal gain, caring only for their own interests.
Those who upheld the values of community and loyalty were regarded as oddities, their attitudes often
met with misunderstanding and isolation.
